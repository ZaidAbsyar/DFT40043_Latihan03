    <h1 id="html">what is HTML?</h1>
    <p>
        Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing.
        HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.
        The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design
        HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. 
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

    <h2 id="History">History of HTML</h2>
    <p>
        HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

        Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.

        A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.
        Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, 
        the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the grammar.
        The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes.
        Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]

After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.

    <h3 id="tags&attribute">Tags & Attribute</h3>
    <p>
        Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.

        They work together but perform different functions – it is worth investing 2 minutes in differentiating the two.
        The id attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element. This is used to identify the element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties, and scripts may alter, animate or delete its contents or presentation. 
        Appended to the URL of the page, it provides a globally unique identifier for the element, typically a sub-section of the page. 
        An author may use the style attribute to assign presentational properties to a particular element. It is considered better practice to use an element's id or class attributes to select the element from within a stylesheet, 
        though sometimes this can be too cumbersome for a simple, specific, or ad hoc styling.
        The title attribute is used to attach subtextual explanation to an element. In most browsers this attribute is displayed as a tooltip.
        The lang attribute identifies the natural language of the element's contents, which may be different from that of the rest of the document.

        Now that we’ve gotten the basic theory out of the way. It’s time to learn how to build our first website.

        First off, we must ensure that we have the right tools. Most important, we need an HTML editor.

        There are many choices on the market. Here are a handful of the most popular:

        Sublime Text 3
        However, for this tutorial, we will use the Sublime Text 3 as it is free and also offers cross-platform support for Windows, Mac, and Linux users.
        
        Visual Studio code
        Visual Studio Code is an open-source, free HTML editor from Microsoft built on Github’s Electron. With this framework, users can create projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript across multiple operating systems. 

        Visual Studio Code is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. It also integrates with Microsoft Azure which makes it easy for code deployment. Users can develop projects and applications locally and publish them to Azure using a single click.

        This open-source code editor uses IntelliSense features to provide different types of auto-completion, including variables, fields, and function definitions. In addition, users can install language extensions, like Python and Ruby, to allow IntelliSense to work with other programming languages. 

        Furthermore, its clean and straightforward interface makes it easy to locate various HTML editing tools, open a new file, and search documents.
